## 🗄️ Database Architecture

### Main Database (`kings_choice.db`)
```sql
users (
    id, username, email, password_hash,
    is_admin, is_active, created_at, last_login,
    database_path,
    telegram_bot_token, telegram_chat_id, telegram_enabled,
    discord_bot_token, discord_channel_id, discord_enabled
)
```

### User Databases (`user_databases/user_X_username.db`)
Each user gets their own complete database with:
- `players` (with user_id foreign key)
- `alliances` (with user_id foreign key) 
- `events` (with user_id foreign key)
- `mvp_assignments`
- `winner_assignments`
- `guides` (with user_id foreign key)
- `guide_categories` (with user_id foreign key)
- `blacklist` (with user_id foreign key)

## 🚀 Production Deployment

### Simple Setup (New Way)
```bash
# One-time setup
python setup_multi_user.py

# Start application
python start_multi_user.py start

# Check status
python start_multi_user.py status

# View logs
python start_multi_user.py logs

# Stop application
