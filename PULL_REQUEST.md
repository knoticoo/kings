## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Tables Implemented
- **players**: Player information with MVP tracking
- **alliances**: Alliance information with winner tracking  
- **events**: Game events requiring MVP/winner assignments
- **mvp_assignments**: MVP assignment history with rotation tracking
- **winner_assignments**: Alliance winner history with rotation tracking

### Key Relationships
- One MVP per event (unique constraint)
- One winner alliance per event (unique constraint)
- Cascading deletes maintain data integrity
- Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity

## 🔄 Core Rotation Logic

### MVP Rotation Algorithm
```python
def can_assign_mvp():
    """
    Returns True only when:
    1. First assignment ever (always allowed)
    2. All current players have been MVP at least once
    """
```

### Winner Rotation Algorithm
```python
def can_assign_winner():
    """
    Returns True only when:
    1. First assignment ever (always allowed) 
    2. All current alliances have won at least once
    """
```

This ensures **fair distribution** and prevents the same player/alliance from winning repeatedly.
