## 🔍 Key Features Breakdown

### 🏆 MVP Assignment Logic
```python
# Core rotation logic ensures fairness
def can_assign_mvp():
    """
    Returns True only when:
    1. No players exist (impossible to assign)
    2. First assignment ever (always allowed)
    3. All current players have been MVP at least once
    """
    
def get_eligible_players():
    """
    Returns players eligible for MVP:
    1. If first round: players who haven't been MVP
    2. If subsequent rounds: players with minimum MVP count
    """
```

### 🛡️ Alliance Winner Logic
```python
# Identical fair rotation for alliances
def can_assign_winner():
    """Same logic as MVP but for alliances"""
    
def get_eligible_alliances():
    """Same logic as players but for alliances"""
```

### 📊 Database Schema
```sql
-- Players with MVP tracking
CREATE TABLE players (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    is_current_mvp BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    mvp_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    created_at DATETIME,
    updated_at DATETIME
);

-- Alliances with winner tracking
CREATE TABLE alliances (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(100) UNIQUE NOT NULL,
    is_current_winner BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    win_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0,
    created_at DATETIME,
    updated_at DATETIME
);

-- Events that need assignments
CREATE TABLE events (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    name VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL,
    description TEXT,
    event_date DATETIME,
    has_mvp BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    has_winner BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    created_at DATETIME
);

-- MVP assignment tracking
CREATE TABLE mvp_assignments (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    player_id INTEGER REFERENCES players(id),
    event_id INTEGER REFERENCES events(id),
    assigned_at DATETIME,
    UNIQUE(event_id)  -- One MVP per event
);

-- Winner assignment tracking
CREATE TABLE winner_assignments (
    id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY,
    alliance_id INTEGER REFERENCES alliances(id),
    event_id INTEGER REFERENCES events(id),
    assigned_at DATETIME,
    UNIQUE(event_id)  -- One winner per event
);
```
